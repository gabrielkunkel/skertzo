My intentions with this project were

* To see lodash in action.
* To get a deeper understanding of object-oriented JavaScript.
* To know AngularJs like a proctologist knows his patients.
* To learn TDD by example.
* To witness how a major library/program could be developed step-by-step.
* To be exposed to numerous algorithms which may inform me as I tackle my own.
* To learn some of the subtlties in JavaScript.
* To learn how a language parser might be built.
